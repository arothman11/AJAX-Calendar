Creative Portion:
For our creative portion, we did the following:
- events in calendar are ordered by time 
- events can be tagged by color, and the user can filter to view events by color 
- users can click to see a yearly view, and can navigate to past and future years, and can click on any month to pull up the monthly view 
- return button in yearly view brings user to the month they were viewing before clicking on the yearly view 
- the form to edit an event autofills to include the previous values for that event 
- users can chose to set an event as all day and not put in a time, and they can edit this later as well 
- unregistered users can see a blank monthly calendar, and can also click to see the yearly view
- users can share events with other registered users, and the same event will be created in the other user's calendar
